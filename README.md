# langraph-stateful-multi-agents

LangGraph enables us to create stateful, multi-actor applications utilizing LLMs as easily as possible. It extends the capabilities of LangChain:
* introducing the ability to create and manage cyclical graphs, which are pivotal for developing sophisticated agent runtimes. 

The core concepts of LangGraph include: 
- graph structure, 
- state management, and 
- coordination.
